{"name":"PRETZEL","tagline":"Light-weight and portable linear structure playground","body":"The foremost and primary goal of pretzel is to create a portable and minimalistic webGL visualization framework for 3D linear structures (i.e. biological chromosome). The library also provide a wide variety of utilities to interact with, examine, and simulate the structures in close details. \r\n\r\n### Features\r\n##### High level abstraction\r\n\r\n##### Simple and straightforward APIs\r\n\r\n##### Simulation and data generator\r\n\r\n###Quick Start\r\nSimply source pretzel into your html\r\ncreate a 'div' with unique id\r\n```html\r\n    <html>\r\n        <head>\r\n            <script src=\"pretzel.js\"></script>\r\n        </head>\r\n        <body>\r\n            <div id=\"canvasId\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"></div>\r\n        </body>\r\n    <html>\r\n```\r\nBegin by creating a viewer port for an existing <div> element. Multiple view ports can be created on the same page\r\n```javascript\r\n    window.onload = function(){\r\n        var viewer = new Pretzel.Viewer(\"canvasId\");\r\n        viewer.init(); //init has to be called to setup the scene.\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nInstantiate a chromosome (linear structure) Object\r\n```javascript\r\n    var bag = new Pretzel.Bag(); //Bagging as way to put structures into collections\r\n    var structure = new Pretzel.Structure(\"chr1\");\r\n    structure.setLength(122300);\r\n    structure.randStructure(100)\r\n    bag.add(structure);\r\n```\r\nThe structures or collection of structure can be rendered with viewer's APIs\r\n```javascript\r\n    viewer.viewBag(bag)\r\n    //Alternatively individual structure can be rendered - viewer.viewStructure(structure)\r\n```\r\nAdd all sort of information (sugar) on top of the rendered structures\r\n```javascript\r\n    //Specify the region of interest to add information\r\n    var info = new PRETZEL.ChromosomeDecorator(bag.getChromosome(\"chr1\"), 4000, 12000);\r\n    var decoratorBag = new PRETZEL.Bag();\r\n    decoratorBag.add(info);\r\n    viewer.viewBag(decoratorBag);\r\n```\r\nSetup any type of interactors which facilitate interactions with the 3D Structures. Several default\r\n```javascript\r\n    viewer.InteractorFactory('mapInteractor');\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe project is developed and maintained by Thanh Le (@lexxx233)\r\n\r\n### Support & Contact\r\nHaving trouble?
